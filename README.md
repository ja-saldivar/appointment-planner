## General Information
- Create an app that manages contacts and appointments.


## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- React


## Objectives
- Use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments. Work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks.


## Tasks
- **Implement App as a stateful component that maintains appointments and contacts**
- **Implement ContactsPage as a stateful component to handle the logic for adding new contacts and listing current contacts**
- **Implement ContactForm as a stateless component that renders a web form to collect the necessary contact information**
- **Implement TileList as a stateless component that renders a list of Tile components using an array of objects**
- **Implement Tile as a stateless component that renders the data from an object**
- **Implement AppointmentsPage as a stateful component that handles the logic for adding new appointments and listing current appointments**
- **Implement AppointmentForm as a stateless component that renders a web form to collect the necessary appointment information**
- **Implement ContactPicker as a stateless component that renders a drop-down list of all contact names**

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
